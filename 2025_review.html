                        I've been inspired by the reflective spirit of year-end to look back at all the things I made in 2025. 
                        Some of them don't even feel like they were from this year anymore — it's probably a good representation
                        of how weird and long and generally overwhelming it has been. (I am a human and I use em dashes.)

                        I started this painting in late October 2024 and finished it in January 2025, just in time for the intended recipient's birthday. Apparently he forgot that
                        he had inquired about commissioning a painting, but it took me a few months to think of a subject that both matched his prompt ("Tomato art, no adult themes") and
                        was exciting for me to work on. Tomatoes by themselves were not quite thrilling enough on their own. I'm particularly pleased with the inexplicable extra hands (for
                        holding more tomatoes) in the era of weird inexplicable AI-generated art.
                        <br><br>
                        I took my first acrylic painting class at <a href="https://lillstreet.com/">Lillstreet Art Center</a> in 2023, and I loved the end products, but it. is. so. time. consuming. 
                        I'd love to paint more, but I need more hours in the day, and/or maybe much smaller canvasses.

                        I am a sucker for a crafting kit, and this one was probably a palate cleanser after I attempted an impossible crochet kit earlier this year. I have a 
                        backlog of these that I bought in Japan – the felting kits in particular are so satisfying and cute! I don't think this took more than a day or two.
