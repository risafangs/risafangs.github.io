                        I've been inspired by the reflective spirit of year-end to look back at all the things I made in 2025. 
                        Some of them don't even feel like they were from this year anymore — it's probably a good representation
                        of how weird and long and generally overwhelming it has been. (I am a human and I use em dashes.)

                            I took my first acrylic painting class at <a href="https://lillstreet.com/" class="link">Lillstreet Art Center</a> in 2023, and I loved the end products, 
                            but it. is. so. time. consuming. I'd love to paint more, but I need more hours in the day, and/or much smaller canvasses.

                            I'm a sucker for a crafting kit!!! This one was a palate cleanser after I attempted an impossible crochet kit earlier in the year. 
                            I have a backlog of these that I bought in Japan – the felting kits in particular are so satisfying and cute! 
                            I don't think this took more than a day or two.

                            My friend and I went to a beginner workshop at the <a href="https://chicagoschoolofshoemaking.com/" class="link">Chicago School of Shoemaking and Leather Arts</a> 
                            and immediately wanted to do more, so I enrolled in the Molded Vegetable-tanned Leather class and made this bag. This one was an ~8 hr class in 4 total sessions
                            that continually felt like a race against time. You also have to make so many important design decisions right away, like choosing shape, colors of each element, etc.
                            I was very stressed, but I love what I made. I bought the moon-shaped stone later on especially to cover up the rivet, and it adds so much!

                            I thought it was a good idea to buy blank postcards because I didn't like the ones I was seeing online, but this took a ton of effort.
                            I made these for a letter writing campaign in advance of the Wisconsin Supreme Court election in the spring, and some of them turned 
                            pretty cute! But yeah, next time I'm printing something.

                            In April, RuPaul's Drag Race Season 17 ended, but more notably, contestant Suzie Toot debuted her cherry bomb wig on stage and ate at
                            the Lalaparuza challenge. I love this look and it definitely inspired some art. I'm including this sketch only because it was such a notable 
                            moment in my year! There's more Suzie stuff in my mini-drawings collection at the end.

                            I'm obsessed with this bag. I made it in my third(!) <a href="https://www.chicagoschoolofshoemaking.com/" class="link">Chicago School of Shoemaking and Leather Arts</a> 
                            class this year. This took about ~12 hours? As usual, I was very stressed about the choices (I <i>agonized</i> over the red thread) but I'm super happy with it.
                            If you look at it closely, you can tell that I don't know how to sew straight, but from a reasonable distance, it looks clean and expensive. Good enough for me. 
                            I think, at this point, I have enough bag construction skills to be able to make something like this on my own, and I'm excited to try.

                            Polymer clay is a steadfast part of my crafting repertoire, so I didn't think to take pictures of all the things I've made this year. Most of them were 
                            towards the end of the year. I made some Koroks (a usual favorite), the chicken is a <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/index.php?title=Cucco" class="link">Cucco attempt</a>, 
                            and a Bat Signal ornament (for the annual celebration of Batsmas). I regret not getting a picture of the mini gnome I made for a friend's gnome-themed birthday,
                            but maybe I can eventually get one in its new home.

                            I worked on these throughout the year. They're more or less lined up from old to new, so the Zelda themes at the top are the earlier ones and the Pikachu at the bottom was from a few days ago. Honestly, the older ones seem better. 
                            <br><br>
                            During my last trip to Japan in November 2023, I let myself purchase a starter pack of <a href="https://copicmarkers.com/collections/ciao-marker-sets" class="link">Copic Ciao markers</a>. It felt so impractical, because when do I ever draw or color?! 
                            so I decided to make small drawings to have something to do with this extra thick paper I had, and a way to practice with my new markers. I figured out later that people who do amazing things with Copics tend to use a million shades (instead of blending the ones they have), 
                            so it's hard to use a limited palette, but this is not an acceptable reason to buy like 40 more Copics, so here's my small collection of mediocre-ly colored drawings.
                            <br><br>
                            I want to get back into doodling! and I think the only way to do it is to just keep drawing, even if you're not thrilled with your drawings. I was never the greatest at drawing, but even as a high schooler I never ran out of things I wanted to draw, and I feel this lack of imagination acutely now.
